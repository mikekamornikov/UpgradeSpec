To get the most out of Sugar we recommend being on the latest version. Newer versions of Sugar come with increased performance, bug fixes, and new features in general. Before upgrading Sugar it is highly recommended that the upgrade be run on a test or backup copy of your production system first. This will not only allow you to be familiar with the process, but can point out any potential issue(s) you may encounter when upgrading your production instance
