## Run health checker and fix all errors

Prior to attempting to upgrade to any 7.x release, Sugar recommends using the Health Check tool. The health check will notify you of any issues within your instance which will affect your ability to upgrade to your target version. For more information on running the health check, please refer to the Installation and Upgrade Guide specific to your version and edition of Sugar.

Download [health checker](url) and run it.

## Backup or rewrite core changes

If your build sources are GIT driven ("sugarcrm/Mango" fork) find all your core changes and (if possible) rewrite them in upgrade safe way. This way you'll avoid merge conflicts during the upgrade.
If it's not possible be sure to track and backup such changes. There is a big chance some of them:
- are implemented by core dev team in the version you plan to upgrade to
- make no sense anymore
- cause additional issues on its own (for example require missing file)
