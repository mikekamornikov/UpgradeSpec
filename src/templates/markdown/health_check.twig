Prior to attempting to upgrade to any 7.x release, Sugar recommends using the Health Check tool. The health check will notify you of any issues within your instance which will affect your ability to upgrade to your target version. For more information on running the health check, please refer to the Installation and Upgrade Guide specific to your version and edition of Sugar.
